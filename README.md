🚀 Getting Started

🔧 Prerequisites

To work with this repository, you need:

🛠 Apache Spark installed locally or access to Databricks

🐍 Python (if using PySpark) or ☕ Scala (for Spark on JVM)

📓 Jupyter Notebook (if running Spark locally)

🖥 Git (for version control)

📥 Setting Up

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/spark_databricks_handson.git
cd spark_databricks_handson

Open Databricks and import notebooks from the notebooks/ directory.

If running locally, ensure Spark is set up and use spark-shell (Scala) or pyspark (Python).
